# Porfolio project Responsive Club website

## Project Goals
In this project, I built a club group page that dynamically responds as you adjust the size of your screen.

## Project Description
The project demonstrates many of the responsive design tools I have learned. I use percentages and relative units, such as em and rem, in my CSS to size and position page elements. I also made my website responsive by incorporating media queries to resize elements based on the size of the screen.

I also made images toggle to certain percentages in terms of width after a certain minimum screen size,
and used a @media rule to change page layout and behavior based on size breakpoints.
